# noSoshApi

## Purpose

This homework was assigned to help us get more comfortable with mongodb, and with using mongoose to write our data models. We created an API for a social network using the CRUD method.

## Issues

This assignment gave me a little bit of trouble with one of the thought routes and how i can make it need a user id to post it to that user. Also my work is not finished there still needs to be 4 more routes total including the friends, and reactions POST and DELETE.
